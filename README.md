# Scrape2Insights (News + Finance)

*A simple, secure website that gathers public information from the web (news headlines and financial prices), cleans it, and shows the results in an easy dashboard. You can also download the data or connect to it through a documented API.*

---

## What this website does 

* **Collects data** from a couple of public sources (e.g., Hacker News for tech headlines and CoinGecko/Yahoo Finance for prices).
* **Cleans and organizes** that data so it’s not duplicated or messy.
* **Stores it safely** in a database so we can search it fast later.
* **Shows insights** in a friendly dashboard: trending stories, price charts, top movers, etc.
* **Keeps the system healthy** by tracking whether the data collectors are running well.
* **Lets you export** the results (CSV) or **connect via API** if you want to build on top of it.

> Think of it as a **data service** rather than a news site: it *collects and organizes* content from elsewhere and gives you tools to explore it.

## Who it’s for

* **Curious readers or students** who want a quick, clean overview of what’s trending in tech and how markets are moving.
* **Startup folks, analysts, or product managers** who want a single place to monitor headlines and prices together.
* **Internal teams** who need reliable, exportable data with a simple API.

## What you’ll see in the app

1. **Sign in / Sign up** – Create an account and log in securely.

2. **Insights Dashboard** –

   * **News**: top stories, trends over time, filters by source/date/tag.
   * **Finance**: price charts and simple stats (change over 24h, 7d, etc.).

3. **Operations Dashboard** –

   * See when the last data collection ran, how long it took, and if anything failed.
   * Simple health indicators (success rate, time since last run).

4. **Data Export** – Download curated results as CSV.

5. **API Access** – A link to the API docs if you (or your developer friend) want to use the data programmatically.

## Why this is useful

* **Saves time**: one place to check both headlines and prices.
* **Trust the data**: duplicates removed, formats standardized, and basic quality checks applied.
* **Shareable**: export a spreadsheet or point a notebook/app to the API.

---

## What it is *not*

* It is **not a news publisher**. We don’t write articles; we organize public info.
* It is **not a trading tool**. We show simple price charts and changes; no financial advice.

---

## Demo data sources

* **News**: Hacker News (tech stories).
* **Finance**: CoinGecko or Yahoo Finance (prices and basic market data).

> We use sources that allow responsible programmatic access and follow good-citizen rules (rate limits, polite fetching).
